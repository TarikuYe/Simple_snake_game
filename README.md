# 🐍 Simple Snake Game (HTML + Internal JS/CSS)

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using just **one HTML file**. All the **JavaScript** and **CSS** are written internally (within the same file). The game runs directly in the browser without needing any external dependencies.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `snake_game.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
3. Use the arrow keys (⬅️⬆️➡️⬇️) to control the snake.
## Game Modes

| Mode   | Speed (ms per move) | Description             |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Easy   | 200 ms               | Slower, beginner level  |
| Medium | 120 ms               | Standard gameplay speed |
| Hard   | 80 ms                | Fast and challenging    |

You can select the difficulty mode from a dropdown or buttons before starting the game.
